    entry: ! 'A **method** is a reusable section of code written to perform a specific
      task in a program. You might be wondering why you need to separate your code
      into methods, rather than just writing everything out in one big chunk. It turns
      out there are a few good reasons to divide your programs into methods:


      1. If something goes wrong in your code, it''s much easier to find and fix bugs
      if you''ve organized your program well. Assigning specific tasks to separate
      methods helps with this organization.


      2. By assigning specific tasks to separate methods (an idea computer scientists
      call **separation of concerns**), you make your program less redundant and your
      code more reusable—not only can you repeatedly use the same method in a single
      program without rewriting it each time, but you can even use that method in
      *another* program.


      3. When we learn more about **objects**, you''ll find out there are a lot of
      interesting things we can do with methods in Ruby.'

      However, the block that we define (following `.each`) will only be called *once*,
