      word for something that has a value (like `4`, `true`, or `pants`). If that
      expression is `true`, Ruby executes the block of code that follows the `if`.
      If it's not true (that is, `false`), Ruby doesn't execute that block of code:
      it skips it and goes on to the next thing.\n\nHere's an example of an `if` statement
      in action:\n\n    if 1 < 2\n      print \"I'm getting printed because one is
      less than two!\"\n    end\n\nRuby doesn't care about **whitespace** (spaces
      and blank lines), so the indentation of the print statement isn't *necessary*.
      However, it's a convention that Rubyists (Ruby enthusiasts) follow, so it's
      good to get in the habit now. The block of code following an `if` should be
      indented two spaces.\n\nWhen you're done with your `if`, you have to tell Ruby
