      insist on giving you the wrong thing, you may have to re-ask them several times
      before you get the kind of input you''re looking for.


      To accomplish this, we use something called a `while` loop. It checks to see
      if a certain condition is true, and `while` it is, the loop keeps running. As

      stopped when `counter` hit 11.


      What if we''d forgotten to increment `counter`? It would have stayed at 1, the
      loop would have kept checking to see if it was less than 11 (and 1 is always
      less than 11), and the loop would never have ended. This is called an **infinite
      loop** and it will cause your programs to crash. Avoid them at all costs!'

      As is often the case in Ruby, however, there's more than one way to accomplish
      a given task. In this case, it's also possible to repeat an action using an
      **iterator**.\n\nAn iterator is just a Ruby method that repeatedly invokes a
      block of code. The code block is just the bit that contains the instructions
      to be repeated, and those instructions can be just about anything you like!\n\nThe
      simplest iterator is the `loop` method. You can create a basic (but infinite!)
      loop by simply typing\n\n    loop { print \"Hello, world!\" }\n\nIn Ruby, curly
      braces (`{}`) are generally interchangeable with the keywords `do` (to open
      the block) and `end` (to close it). Knowing this, we can write a smarter loop
      than the one above:\n\n    i = 0\n    loop do\n      i += 1\n      print \"#{i}\"\n
      \     break if i > 5\n    end\n\nThe `break` keyword is our Get Out of Jail
