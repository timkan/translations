entry: You already know a little bit about arrays. This lesson will teach you more
  about arrays, about a new data structure called a hash, and how Ruby can iterate
  over both to help you build better programs.

    entry: ! "Here's something interesting about arrays: each element in the array
      has what's called an **index**. The first element gets index 0, the next gets
      index 1, the one after that gets index 2, and so on. We can access elements
      of the array directly through these numbers, like so:\n\n    array = [5, 7,
      9, 2, 0]\n    array[2]\n    # returns \"9\", since \"9\"\n    # is at index
      2\n\nThe diagram below shows how these indices work for our sample array, `[5,
      7, 9, 2, 0]`. The first element gets index 0, the next gets 1, the next gets
      2, and so on.\n\n    +---+---+---+---+---+\n    | 5 | 7 | 9 | 2 | 0 |\n    +---+---+---+---+---+\n
      \     0   1   2   3   4\n\n(This is a bit of an oversimplification, but it gets
      the idea across for now.)\n\nWe can access the `i`th element of an array called
      `array` by putting the index in square brackets, like so: `array[i]`. `array[0]`
      gets the first element, `array[1]` gets the second element, and so on. This
      is called **access by index** or **index by offset**."
