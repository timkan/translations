    entry: This project will help you create a small program that will read a user's
      input and correct his or her capitalization. Users can provide an almost infinite
      range of input, so it makes our lives easier as programmers to make their input
      standard before doing anything with it.

    entry: ! 'Great! Now we''ve got our output, but as you can see, we haven''t used
      string methods to properly capitalize everything yet.


      We taught you about `.upcase` and `.downcase`, but there''s another really useful
      string method: `.capitalize`. It capitalizes the first letter of a string and
      makes the rest of the letters lower case. Convenient, right?


      Here''s another handy trick. When you call something like `.capitalize` on a
      string, you''re not capitalizing that *exact* string; Ruby makes a *copy* of
      the string, capitalizes *that*, and that''s what it returns. If you want to
      capitalize the string you''ve already got, though, you can make one small change:
      add a `!` to the end of the method name. `.capitalize!` capitalizes the string
      **in-place** instead of making a copy. The original non-capitalized string is
      gone forever, but now you have your shiny new capitalized one in its place.'
